# HTML/CSS to Webflow Converter - Application Architecture

## Overview

This document outlines the architecture for an application that converts HTML and CSS to native Webflow elements using the style panel rather than embeds or custom elements. The application will be implemented as a Webflow Designer Extension using the Webflow Designer API.

## System Components

### 1. User Interface

The UI will consist of:

- **Input Panel**: Where users can paste HTML and CSS code
- **Preview Panel**: Shows a preview of the converted Webflow elements
- **Options Panel**: Configuration options for the conversion process
- **Conversion Button**: Triggers the conversion process
- **Status Indicator**: Shows the progress and status of the conversion

### 2. HTML Parser

Responsible for parsing the input HTML and creating a structured representation:

- Uses a robust HTML parsing library (Cheerio or DOMParser)
- Creates a DOM tree from the HTML input
- Identifies element types, attributes, and content
- Handles nested structures and special cases

### 3. CSS Parser

Responsible for parsing the input CSS and extracting style rules:

- Uses a CSS parsing library (PostCSS or CSS Parser)
- Extracts selectors, properties, and values
- Handles media queries and other CSS features
- Creates a structured representation of the CSS rules

### 4. Element Mapper

Maps HTML elements to native Webflow elements:

- Contains a mapping dictionary of HTML elements to Webflow element types
- Handles element creation using Webflow Designer API
- Maintains parent-child relationships
- Preserves element attributes and content

### 5. Style Processor

Processes CSS styles and applies them to Webflow elements:

- Analyzes CSS selectors and determines which elements they apply to
- Creates Webflow styles (classes) for reusable style sets
- Applies styles to elements using the Webflow style panel
- Handles CSS specificity and cascading

### 6. Class Naming System

Manages class names to avoid conflicts:

- Generates unique prefixed class names (e.g., "html2wf-")
- Maintains a mapping between original CSS classes and generated Webflow classes
- Handles compound classes and nested selectors
- Ensures no conflicts with existing classes in the project

### 7. Conversion Manager

Orchestrates the conversion process:

- Coordinates the flow between components
- Handles error cases and edge conditions
- Provides progress updates to the UI
- Manages the final application of elements to the Webflow canvas

## Data Flow

1. User pastes HTML and CSS into the input panel
2. HTML Parser processes the HTML and creates a DOM tree
3. CSS Parser processes the CSS and creates a style rule set
4. Element Mapper creates Webflow elements based on the DOM tree
5. Style Processor creates Webflow styles based on the CSS rules
6. Class Naming System ensures unique class names
7. Conversion Manager applies the elements and styles to the Webflow canvas
8. UI updates to show the completed conversion

## Technical Implementation

### Webflow Designer API Integration

The application will use the Webflow Designer API to:

- Create and manipulate elements on the canvas
- Create and apply styles to elements
- Manage the element hierarchy
- Handle user interactions

### HTML Parsing

We'll use Cheerio for HTML parsing because:
- It has a jQuery-like syntax that's easy to work with
- It's lightweight and fast
- It handles malformed HTML well

### CSS Parsing

We'll use PostCSS for CSS parsing because:
- It's widely used and well-maintained
- It creates a workable AST (Abstract Syntax Tree)
- It handles complex CSS features

### Element Mapping Implementation

The element mapper will:
- Use a dictionary to map HTML tags to Webflow element types
- Handle special cases like forms, tables, and multimedia elements
- Preserve element attributes where possible
- Maintain the correct hierarchy

### Style Processing Implementation

The style processor will:
- Match CSS selectors to elements
- Group similar styles into Webflow classes
- Apply unique styles as inline styles where appropriate
- Handle CSS specificity correctly

### Class Naming System Implementation

The class naming system will:
- Use a configurable prefix (default: "html2wf-")
- Generate deterministic class names based on original names
- Handle conflicts by adding numeric suffixes
- Maintain a bidirectional mapping for reference

## Error Handling

The application will handle:
- Malformed HTML or CSS
- Unsupported HTML elements or CSS properties
- Excessive nesting or complexity
- API rate limits or failures
- User input validation

## Performance Considerations

To ensure good performance:
- Process HTML and CSS in chunks for large inputs
- Use efficient data structures for mapping and lookups
- Implement caching where appropriate
- Provide progress feedback for long-running operations

## Extension Configuration

The Webflow Designer Extension will be configured with:
- Appropriate permissions for element and style manipulation
- User interface integration points
- Error reporting mechanisms
- Version information and update paths

## Future Enhancements

Potential future enhancements include:
- Support for JavaScript conversion
- Enhanced handling of responsive designs
- Improved mapping of complex CSS selectors
- Integration with external design systems
- Batch processing of multiple files

## Conclusion

This architecture provides a comprehensive framework for building an HTML/CSS to Webflow converter that uses native Webflow elements and the style panel. By following this design, we can create a robust application that meets the user's requirements and provides a superior alternative to existing tools that use embeds or custom elements.
